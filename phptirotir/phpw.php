Welcome to PHP Essentials with TirotirPHP in VSCode! Here, we'll explore how PHP can enhance your web development skills. Let’s dive into the foundational concepts of PHP and see how it brings dynamic functionality to your web projects.
Before diving into PHP, it's crucial to understand its role in web development and how it integrates with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here’s a summary of important theoretical concepts and PHP fundamentals you should cover:
1. What is PHP?
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose language.
PHP is embedded within HTML code and executed on the server. The resulting output (usually HTML) is sent to the client (browser).
2. Server-Side vs. Client-Side
Server-Side: PHP runs on the server, processes data, interacts with databases, and sends the final HTML to the client.
Client-Side: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript run in the user's browser and handle the presentation and behavior of web pages.
3. PHP Syntax Basics
PHP scripts are embedded within HTML using <?php ... ?> tags.
PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).
Variables in PHP start with a dollar sign ($$), e.g., $variable.
4. Variables and Data Types
PHP supports various data types: integers, floats, strings, arrays, objects, and booleans.
Variables are loosely typed and can change type depending on the assigned value.
5. Control Structures
Conditional Statements: if, else, elseif, switch.
Loops: for, while, do...while, foreach.
6. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
Define a function using function functionName() { ... }.
PHP has both built-in functions (e.g., strlen(), array_merge()) and user-defined functions.
7. Forms and Data Handling
PHP handles form data sent via POST and GET methods.
Use $_POST and $_GET superglobals to access form data.
8. Working with Databases
PHP connects to databases using extensions like mysqli or PDO.
Common database operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
9. Sessions and Cookies
Sessions: Store data across multiple pages for a single user session (e.g., user login state).
Cookies: Store data on the client’s browser (e.g., user preferences).
10. File Handling
PHP can read, write, and manage files on the server.
Functions: fopen(), fclose(), fread(), fwrite().
11. Security Considerations
SQL Injection: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Sanitize user inputs to avoid XSS attacks.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Implement CSRF tokens to protect against unauthorized requests.
12. Error Handling
PHP provides error handling mechanisms like try...catch blocks for exceptions.
Use error_reporting() and ini_set() to control error reporting levels.
13. Integration with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
PHP and HTML: PHP can generate HTML dynamically.
PHP and CSS: PHP can include CSS files or inject styles into HTML output.
PHP and JavaScript: PHP can generate JavaScript code or handle AJAX requests from JavaScript.
